### Brief

Implement an alarm that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two alarms that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

### Running the tests

You can run all the tests by entering the following in your terminal:

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```

### Evaluation Criteria

- Java best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes 
to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
