### Brief

Implement an alarm that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two alarms that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

### Running the tests

You can run all the tests by entering the following in your terminal:

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```
